Looking at your screenshots and code samples, I can see you want to recreate Meta's comprehensive ad previewer. Let me break down exactly what you're asking for and what needs to be implemented:
Current State vs. Target State
Your Current App Has:

Single preview with basic platform/device/type toggles
Simple chip-based controls
One preview container showing Facebook-style ads

Meta's Previewer Has:

Grid layout with multiple simultaneous previews
Categorized sections (Feeds, Stories & Reels, In-stream ads, etc.)
Modal "View Preview" with dropdown switcher
Precise pixel-perfect ad layouts

Detailed Requirements Breakdown
1. Full Previewer Grid Layout
Replace your single preview with a comprehensive grid showing:
Categories to implement:

Feeds: Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Facebook Video feeds, Facebook Right column, Instagram Explore Feed
Stories and Reels: Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories, Messenger Stories, Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels
In-stream ads: Facebook In-stream videos
Search results: Facebook Marketplace Search

Layout specifications:

6-column grid with 24px gaps
Each preview card: 250px width × 488px height
Category headers with section spacing
Responsive grid that collapses on smaller screens

2. View Preview Modal System
Create a full-screen modal that:

Opens when clicking any grid preview or the new "expand" button
Shows enlarged single preview (same content as grid, but bigger)
Has dropdown at top-left to switch between placements
Includes close button (×) at top-right
Dark overlay background
Modal should be 80% of screen width/height, centered

3. Enhanced Preview Controls
Modify your existing Preview Controls section:
Add dropdown selector:

Place directly under "Preview Controls" heading
Dropdown should list all available placements
When selected, automatically updates your existing chip controls
Should sync bidirectionally with chips

Add expand button:

Place to the right of "Preview Controls" heading
Icon: expand/fullscreen symbol
Clicking opens View Preview modal

4. Zoom Controls Bar
At bottom of preview section, next to your existing note:

Zoom Out button (- icon)
Zoom In button (+ icon)
Expand to Full Previewer button
Should affect the preview scaling

5. Pixel-Perfect Ad Layouts
This is the most complex part. You need to recreate exact Meta ad layouts:
Facebook Feed Layout:

Profile image (40px circle)
Brand name + "Sponsored" + privacy icon
Post text with proper line-height
Image with exact aspect ratios
Link card with domain/headline/description
CTA button with proper styling
Like/Comment/Share buttons

Instagram Feed Layout:

Different header layout
CTA button over image
Action buttons (heart, comment, share, bookmark)
"View all comments" text

Stories/Reels Layouts:

9:16 vertical format
Overlay text and buttons
Progress bars at top
Different background gradients

Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Structure Setup

Create new components for Full Previewer and View Preview modal
Implement grid layout system
Add modal overlay system
Create dropdown component that syncs with existing chips

Phase 2: Ad Layout Recreation

Study the provided HTML/CSS from Meta's actual previewer
Create component for each ad placement type
Implement proper typography (likely need to match Meta's fonts)
Add proper spacing, colors, and interactive elements
Ensure responsive behavior

Phase 3: Enhanced Controls

Add zoom functionality
Implement expand/collapse behaviors
Create seamless transitions between views
Add keyboard navigation support

Technical Challenges to Address
Font Matching: Meta uses specific fonts that may need web font loading
Icon Accuracy: Need exact Meta icons (Like, Comment, Share, etc.)
Color Precision: Must match Meta's exact color schemes
Spacing/Alignment: Pixel-perfect matching of Meta's layouts
Responsive Behavior: Ensure previews work across different screen sizes
Performance: Grid with multiple previews needs optimization

The platform restrictions are HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP - we are use Siteground.

I'd like the keep the same react-like design as meta and how my app currently looks keep it consistent

Review the text file in font.txt to see fonts

Lets create a separate test application first
